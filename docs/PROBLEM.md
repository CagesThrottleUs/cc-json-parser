# Problem Statement

We have to create a simple CLI application that will validate the JSON provided by the user. The JSON is described with
the attached document. (Language Specification Document) [here](./language_document.pdf)

The CLI application must accept file path as argument.

# Where to get tests

I got two set of challenges that I have put into two different directories. These are gitignored - so user is expected
to add them into the project for the following folder names:

1. [challenges](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vthtr4897fkuhw8/tests.zip?dl=1)
2. [testsuite](https://www.json.org/JSON_checker/test.zip)
3. [hardcore](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnst%2FJSONTestSuite%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Ftest_parsing)
